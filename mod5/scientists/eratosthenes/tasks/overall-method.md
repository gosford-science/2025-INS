# Replicating Eratosthenes’ Measurement of Earth’s Circumference in the Southern Hemisphere

Name: Hudson Brown

Date: 24th October 2024

## Abstract

(To be completed after conducting the experiment. Summarize the purpose, method, results, and conclusions in a brief paragraph.)

## Introduction

Eratosthenes of Cyrene was a Greek mathematician, geographer, and astronomer who lived between 276 and 194 BCE. He is famous for being the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth with reasonable accuracy. Using simple geometric observations and measurements of shadows in different locations, Eratosthenes demonstrated not only that the Earth is spherical but also provided an estimate of its size.

He observed that at noon on the summer solstice in Syene (now Aswan, Egypt), the sun was directly overhead, illuminating the bottom of deep wells and casting no shadow from vertical objects. At the same time in Alexandria, approximately 800 kilometers to the north, vertical objects cast a shadow, indicating that the sun was at an angle to the vertical. By measuring this angle and knowing the distance between the two cities, Eratosthenes used basic geometry to calculate the Earth’s circumference.

## Objective

The objective of this experiment is to replicate Eratosthenes’ method in the Southern Hemisphere to calculate the Earth’s circumference by measuring the angle of the sun at local solar noon.

### **Instructions for Participants**

Please detail the instructions, test the method and include a section for errors.

You should test the method and provide a discussion of potential errors.

(Feel free to adjust the method based on your specific setup and whether you’re collaborating with another location.)

## Results

(Present the data collected from your experiment. Include tables, charts, or graphs as appropriate.)

	•	(Include a labeled diagram showing the stick, shadow, and angles measured.)

# Data Analysis

(Use your measurements to calculate the Earth’s circumference. Show all formulas, calculations, and reasoning. Consider the following steps:)

1.	Calculating the Sun’s Angle:
•	θ = arctangent (height of stick / length of shadow)
•	Show your calculation with the measured values.
2.	Determining the Fraction of Earth’s Circumference:
•	The angle θ represents the angular difference between your location and the point where the sun is directly overhead at solar noon.
•	Fraction of Earth’s circumference = θ / 360°
3.	Calculating Earth’s Circumference:
•	Distance between your location and the point directly under the sun (arc length) can be determined or estimated.
•	Earth’s circumference = (Distance between two points) / (Fraction of Earth’s circumference)
•	Show all steps and calculations.
4.	Example Calculation:
•	(Provide an example using hypothetical numbers to illustrate the process.)

# Discussion

(Analyze your results. Reflect on the following points:)

	•	Accuracy of Your Measurement:
	•	How does your calculated Earth’s circumference compare with the accepted value (~40,075 km)?
	•	Calculate the percentage error.
	•	Sources of Error:
	•	Discuss potential errors in measurement (e.g., stick not perfectly vertical, shadow blurred, timing inaccuracies).
	•	Consider environmental factors (e.g., uneven ground, atmospheric refraction).
	•	Assumptions Made:
	•	Assuming the Earth is a perfect sphere.
	•	Ignoring the effect of time zones and the equation of time on solar noon.
	•	Improvements:
	•	Suggest ways to improve the experiment for better accuracy.
	•	Consider technological tools or collaborating with other locations.

Conclusion

(Summarize the outcomes of your experiment. State whether the objective was achieved and what you learned from the activity.)

	•	Key Findings:
	•	Restate the calculated circumference.
	•	Comment on the reliability of your result.
	•	Learning Outcomes:

- **Clear Area:** Conduct the experiment in an open area free from obstructions that could cast additional shadows.
- **Multiple Trials:** Take multiple measurements of the shadow length and calculate an average to improve accuracy.
- **Use Proper Tools:** Utilize precise measuring instruments like a ruler or measuring tape and a reliable protractor or angle-measuring device.
- **Verify Solar Noon:** Use reputable sources or tools to confirm the exact time of solar noon for your location to ensure measurements are taken at the correct time.
