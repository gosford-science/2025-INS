**Summer solstice in Australia **

The summer solstice, the day with the longest period of daylight, has
been observed and understood by cultures worldwide for millennia.

Much of the historical documentation we readily find focuses on Northern
Hemisphere perspectives. However, Australia and the Torres Strait
Islands have a rich Indigenous history stretching back tens of thousands
of years, and their peoples also developed intricate knowledge of the
sun’s movements.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people observe the solstices and
other significant sunrise/sunset points along the horizon for
timekeeping and indicating seasonal change but in ways that are
different to the four-season model developed in Western Europe.

Below is a case study extract from the first reference below which
details various Indigenous astronomical sites. Read this and then answer
the short questions below.

<th><p><strong>Case study</strong></p>
<p>The Wurdi Youang stone arrangement (also known as the Mount Rothwell
Archaeological Site) is located near the Little River, north of the You
Yangs range between Melbourne and Geelong.</p>
<p>The site consists of approximately 100 basalt stones arranged in an
oval pattern with its major axis aligned East/West and a diameter of 50
m. The stones vary in height, with the tallest standing about 0.75 m
high and individual stones weighing upwards of 500 kg (with an estimated
total mass of 23 tonnes). The landscape is fairly barren, with bedrock
sticking above the soil throughout the area. The arrangement has been
preserved and is protected (Lane and Fullagar, 1980).</p>
<p>In August 1971, schoolteacher Louis Lane and a friend stumbled upon
the stones (Lane, 1975). After years of study and lobbying, the
arrangement (then called the Mount Rothwell Stone Arrangement) was
granted heritage status in 1977 by the Victorian Archaeological Survey
(AAV Site No. 7922-001), the first Aboriginal site in the state to
achieve this classification. Lane had considered the site may contain
astronomical alignments and wrote to prominent archaeo-astronomer
Alexander Thom in the UK in 1973 for this thoughts, enclosing
photographs and survey details.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, local historian John Morieson began studying the site
and hypothesised that outlier stones west of the primary arrangement
aligned to the position of the setting Sun at the solstices and
equinoxes (Morieson 2003).</p>
<p>In 2006, Ray and Priscilla Norris worked closely with local custodian
Trevor ‘Reg’ Abrahams to survey the arrangement in detail and test this
hypothesis.</p>
<p>The authors of this paper concluded that Morieson’s hypothesis was
plausible and supported by the survey. They also noted that the linear
northerly and southerly sides of the arrangement aligned to the
solstices if observed from its eastern apex, and the Sun sets at equinox
directly over the middle of three prominent, 0.6-m high stones at the
western apex (which is also the highest point of the
arrangement).</p></th>

The Wurdi Youang stone arrangement and the hypothesised solar
alignments, from Norris et al. (2013). The point where the lines
converges is the best vantage point for observing the solar markers.

**Questions**

1.  **Describe key features of the site and what its purpose appears to
    be.**

2.  **What might be the importance of seasonal change to Indigenous
    people? For instance, what might season changes mean for available
    food?**
