**Modern measurement of the Earth’s circumference**

The Earth's circumference is not the same around the equator as it is
through the poles because the Earth is not a perfect sphere. The Earth
is an oblate spheroid, meaning it bulges at the equator and is slightly
flattened. The circumference of the Earth around the equator is
40,075.017 km, while the circumference through the poles is 40,007.863
km. 

Satellite geodesy is defined as the precise measurement and
understanding of Earth's gravitational field, geometric shape, and
orientation in space using space-based geodetic methods like satellite
laser ranging and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS).

One of these is the Global Positioning System (GPS), originally Navstar
GPS, is a [satellite-based radio
navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionavigation-satellite_service) system
owned by the [United States Space
Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force) and
operated by [Mission Delta
31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Delta_31).
